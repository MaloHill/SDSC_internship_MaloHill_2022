# SDSC_internship_2022
Code and report from the internship "Statistical methods for comparing mass spectra".

Information about the internship can be found in the report, which is in the "report and slides" file together with slides used during presentations.

Experiments, graphics and implementation contain the code in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

Data contains the initial csv files of the spectrum database and additional files produced by the code and useful for running the code.

Note: the directories of the csv files need to be fixed in the code for making it run.
