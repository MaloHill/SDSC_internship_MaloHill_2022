# SDSC_internship_2022
Code and report from the internship "Statistical methods for comparing mass spectra".

Information about the internship can be found in the report, which is in the "report and slides" file together with slides used during presentations.

The code file includes:
-the initial csv files of the spectrum database
-the code in the form of Jupyter notebooks
-additional files produced during the internship and also useful for running the code

Note: the directories of the csv files need to be fixed in the code for making it run.
